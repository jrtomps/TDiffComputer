    Here is a sample implementation of a filter to append a reversed copy of the
    data in physics event to its body. This is for illustration purposes.

    See the documentation for the CFilter base class for the virtually declared 
    methods available for dealing with non-physics events. The user has access 
    to all of the different ring item types. In fact, it is not necessary for 
    the user to return the same type of ring item from method as it received.
